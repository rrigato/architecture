- Always have the name or the person who gave the requirement not a department. 
- Self made billionaries seem to have the following in common: 
1) Insanely brilliant 
2) Insanely large risk takers 
3) Insane

Algorithm for new process:
1) Question every requirement. Each should come with the name of the person who made it. 
2) Delete any process you can. You did not delete enough requirements if you do not need to add as least 10% of them back later.
3) Simplify and optimize. Do not simplify an uneeded process, delete them
4) Speed up iteration time
5) Automate only after bugs removed and requirements deleted
