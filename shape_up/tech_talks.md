# general_advice_from_tech_talks

- focus on knowns/unknowns instead of velocity tasks for determing outstanding work


- backlogs end up being the place you put items you disagree on, do not say no to upfront and end up never doing


- present your pitch in the context of your time constraints in order to prevent scope creep when deciding what to pickup for an iteration




- each vertical scope/ business usecase/ e2e  tracer should first get the functionality working e2e between front end/backend then move onto the next high risk scope before coming back to polish up rough edges within an iteration




- technical risk is binary, either it is solved or more work needs to be done in order to have line of sight to a solution


- Ask yourself what customers do today without this MVP instead of comparing to a perfect solution you haven’t built.


- when scope hammering constantly ask yourself:
 
> if we had to ship tomorrow would this feature be essential or nice to have?




- think about whether the information you are about to communicate to your team is *nice to have* where it is ok if it is missed versus *need to have* where it is mandatory to complete a project.



- be more deliberate about the different task types you are working on throughout the day alternating between asynchronous emails, meetings, deep concentrated work (in the zone)


- for support work you are responsible for a queue, for development work you are responsible for getting *in the zone* at least 3-4 hours a day with the result being you move the project meaningfully forward
