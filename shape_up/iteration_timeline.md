# introduction
Software design phases of a 4 week agile iteration. 

The culmination of every iteration is a shipped product.

Circuit breakers provide hard deadlines where the milestone must be completed or the project is abandonded in order to force tradeoffs.

## agile_iteration_prequisites
- Engineers have uninterrupted allocation for the full iteration 

- disagree and commit

- Engineers empowered to take feedback as feedback and not as a directive

- Engineers empowered to say no to non-essiential bugs/suggestions/feature requests

## week_1
Conceptual design of public interfaces and modules defined as code

### circuit_breakers

#### day_1
- entities and usecase layer 

#### day_2
- openapi spec for api endpoints

#### day_3
- react UI components

#### day_4
- CI/CD pipeline working
- AWS resources

#### day_5
- independent project scopes/features identified
- repo layer


## week_2
Implementation phase where you prioritize the project scopes with the biggest technical unknowns

### circuit_breakers

#### day_1 
- 1 project scope that is demoable even if it is heavily stubbed



#### day_3
- E2E tracer of 1 project scope/feature

#### day_5
- No remaining technical unknowns
- All risks resolved
