- fixed time variable scope = do not ask the time it takes to develop a feature, set how much development time the idea is worth 
- circuit breakers = if you do not deliver a feature within an iteration it does not get an extension
- Start each iteration cycle by building one demoable e2e piece starting with the biggest technical unknowns


# shaping_projects_ch2

- fat marker sketch = rough idea that solves the business problem without the fine details worked out
- Address potiential risks and rabbit holes in your project pitch document


# setting_project_boundaries
- The default response for any new issue should be to not immediately put it in a backlog but to gather the context of whether it is really important and what developer resources it might entail

- define how refactors/redesigns affect a specific business problem statement, because otherwise you will never know when a refactor/v2 of a product is truly done

- Each new feature should have a raw idea, business problem statement, risks, and proposed scope that fits within your time appetite
