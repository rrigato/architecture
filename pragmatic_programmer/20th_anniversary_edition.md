- when you miss a delivery expectation, provide options not excuses
- fix broken windows of bad code design, implementation and roadblocks as soon as they appear
- make quality and scope part of the requirements
- Make a habit of investing in your technical skills by diversifying and managing risk of knowledge gaps in new technologies/programming environments you are not familiar with
