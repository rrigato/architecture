# values
- kaizen = take ownership of constantly improving your work
- when you miss a delivery expectation, provide options not excuses
- fix broken windows of bad code design, implementation and roadblocks as soon as they appear
- make quality and scope part of the requirements
- Make a habit of investing in your technical skills by diversifying and managing risk of knowledge gaps in new technologies/programming environments you are not familiar with
- software engineering values help you make quick decisions by consciously re-enforcing self-discipline
- evaluate each design decision in terms of how easily it can be changed in the future

# communication
> the meaning of your communication is in the response you get

- prepare before communicating, prioritize listening to your audience, consider the correct time to present the material, apply MVP to all communication/meetings
- focus non-api commenting on why something is done because the code shows how it is done, keep DRY in mind
- email is permanent so make sure to reflect before sending and maintain the habit of not complaining no matter the recipient

# dry
- every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system
- whenever a module exposes a data structure it couples your implementation to that data structure
- be cognizant of duplicating business logic in docstrings and the implementation of private functions

# decoupled_systems
- modules should never expose any unnecessary interfaces, never rely on other modules implementations, and have any context passed in as parameters
