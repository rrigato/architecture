# values
- kaizen = take ownership of constantly improving your work
- when you miss a delivery expectation, provide options not excuses
- fix broken windows of bad code design, implementation and roadblocks as soon as they appear
- make quality and scope part of the requirements
- Make a habit of investing in your technical skills by diversifying and managing risk of knowledge gaps in new technologies/programming environments you are not familiar with


# communication
> the meaning of your communication is in the response you get

- prepare before communicating, prioritize listening to your audience, consider the correct time to present the material, apply MVP to all communication/meetings
- focus non-api commenting on why something is done because the code shows how it is done, keep DRY in mind
- email is permanent so make sure to reflect before sending and maintain the habit of not complaining no matter the recipient
