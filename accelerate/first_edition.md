- Measure software delivery performance by the feature request lead time, deployment frequency, time to restore service and change failure percentage
- Deliver work in small batches because it allows you to gather user feedback quickly and take an experimental approach to product development
- use measurement of software delivery performance to improve your processes not as a form of control
- Production incidents rarely have a single root cause but are often a combination of contributing factors

# technical_practices
- TDD and ci/cd technical practices are enablers of more frequent and lower risk deployments
- Split work into small chunks that deliver measureable business outcomes for a small part of your target market so you can get essential feedback and easily course correct
- The goal of working in small batches is to avoid work that delivers zero or negative value and make the cost of pushing an individual feature request to production very low
- Invest in automating regression testing/software delivery to free up individuals to focus on higer value problem solving work
- The most important characteristic of high-performing teams is that they relentlessly pursue continuous improvement and make the strive to get better part of everybody's daily work
- All configuration management to provision environments, build/test/deploy software should be maintained in your version control system
- Keep feature branches at less than one days work and merge them into master frequently
