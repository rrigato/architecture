# overview
- Beyond the senior engineer level(5-8 years of experience), developers need to choose between staying technical (principle/distinguished engineer) and pursuing engineering management

- the tech lead on a team solves/comes up with the solutions for the teams most complex engineering problems

- An architect is responsible for a specific technical domain such as API design, frontend stack, cloud infrastructure

- principle engineers need to decide between being a tech lead on one team or whether they would prefer to be an architect who rotates to solve different problems across a large number of teams
