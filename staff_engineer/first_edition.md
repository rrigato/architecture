# overview
- Beyond the senior engineer level(5-8 years of experience), developers need to choose between staying technical (principle/distinguished engineer) and pursuing engineering management

- the tech lead on a team solves/comes up with the solutions for the teams most complex engineering problems

- An architect is responsible for a specific technical domain such as API design, frontend stack, cloud infrastructure

- principle engineers need to decide between being a tech lead focused on one team's domain or whether they would prefer to be an architect who jumps from team-to-team based on specific projects set by leadership priorities


- The most consistent way to get approval to work on problems that are interesting to you is to get hired with the requirements of doing them

- Don't pursue a distinguished engineer title if you are not ready to step away from the fully allocated development role of a senior software engineer
