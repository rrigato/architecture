# overview
- Beyond the senior engineer level(5-8 years of experience), developers need to choose between staying technical (principle/distinguished engineer) and pursuing engineering management

- the tech lead on a team solves/comes up with the solutions for the teams most complex engineering problems

- An architect is responsible for a specific technical domain such as API design, frontend stack, cloud infrastructure

- principle engineers need to decide between being a tech lead focused on one team's domain or whether they would prefer to be an architect who jumps from team-to-team based on specific projects set by leadership priorities


- The most consistent way to get approval to work on problems that are interesting to you is to get hired with the requirements of doing them

- Don't pursue a distinguished engineer title if you are not ready to step away from the fully allocated development role of a senior software engineer 


# engineering_strategy
- write an engineering strategy to curate technical quality in order to maintain release velocity over time

- engineering strategy is proactive alignment among all engineers that enable quick and confident decisions about foundational principles
    - programming language, iteration structure, code quality standards, development/release process, architecture

- engineering strategy should be a catalog of specific and opinionated technical practices 
    - anyone on the team can dispute, contribute or propose changes

- the key to engineering strategy is to keep it specific and link to general knowledge 

# work_purpose
- pacing your career and life to maximize long term sustainability is driven by the realization that we only have a finite amount of time on this planet and you want to spend it solving high impact problems

- The most meaningful work projects are those that could not of been delivered without you doing them



# managing_technical_quality
- software engineering code quality should be at a high enough standard to align with your scale and release velocity expectations
    - continually re-evaluate if your current software quality standards need to be modified to support future release velocity

- avoid processes that do not reduce risk but are instituted in order to make it clear who is to blame when something goes wrong

- adopt one new best practice at a time, view the new rule as maleable/open to change based on feedback rather than being a mandate, don't be afraid to invoke a circuit breaker and admit it was a bad idea

- do not spend software engineering effort on unproven problems

- the best interfaces decouple clients from the implementation while expoing only the essiential complexity, not any accidental complexity


> if you are not being selective about which projects to take on, you are not thinking broadly enough


- do not create a code stanxard just to have a process, only do so when it is increasing code quality so you can maintain release velocity over time


> continued growth requires learning to incorporate your worldview with the worldview of those around you, accelerating overall progress even if it means a deviation from your original values/vision


- Remain skeptical of yourself by developing a pragmatism for new solutions and agnosticism to technical religion


- do not give feedback on engineer style decisions that do not improve code quality
- never fight feedback syncronously in a meeting
  - reflect on the feedback provided and change the mind of the opposing viewpoint at a later time asyncronously

- There is no such thing as a permanent decision, every decision will be reconsidered over the years


# career_advice
- be honest with yourself about why you are seeking a role change/career move
- Include mentoring/code standards/best practices during performance evaluations
- continually feed your manager with items you have accomplished, not just before a promotion
- speak concisely, prepare your thoughts in advance and have dedicated focus in meetings
- visibility is a transient currency, learning and skill development is a permanent one
