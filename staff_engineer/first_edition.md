# overview
- Beyond the senior engineer level(5-8 years of experience), developers need to choose between staying technical (principle/distinguished engineer) and pursuing engineering management

- the tech lead on a team solves/comes up with the solutions for the teams most complex engineering problems

- An architect is responsible for a specific technical domain such as API design, frontend stack, cloud infrastructure

- principle engineers need to decide between being a tech lead focused on one team's domain or whether they would prefer to be an architect who jumps from team-to-team based on specific projects set by leadership priorities


- The most consistent way to get approval to work on problems that are interesting to you is to get hired with the requirements of doing them

- Don't pursue a distinguished engineer title if you are not ready to step away from the fully allocated development role of a senior software engineer 


# engineering_strategy
- write an engineering strategy to curate technical quality in order to maintain release velocity over time

- engineering strategy is proactive alignment among all engineers that enable quick and confident decisions about foundational principles
    - programming language, iteration structure, code quality standards, development/release process, architecture

- engineering strategy should be a catalog of specific and opinionated technical practices 
    - anyone on the team can dispute, contribute or propose changes

- the key to engineering strategy is to keep it specific and link to general knowledge 

# work_purpose
- pacing your career and life to maximize long term sustainability is driven by the realization that we only have a finite amount of time on this planet and you want to spend it solving high impact problems

- The most meaningful work projects are those that could not of been delivered without you doing them



# managing_technical_quality
- software engineering code quality should be at a high enough standard to align with your scale and release velocity expectations
    - continually re-evaluate if your current software quality standards need to be modified to support future release velocity

- avoid processes that do not reduce risk but are instituted in order to make it clear who is to blame when something goes wrong
