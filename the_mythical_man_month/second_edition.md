- The difference between a program that runs and a program that is a product offering is that the latter is generalized, well documented/tested with defined interfaces
- As soon as one freezes the design it becomes obsolete, but implementation of real products demands versioning
- The obsolesence of an implementation can only be measured when compared against other existing implementations, not unrealized concepts

# ch2_estimation_myths
- The number of software engineers does not always result in a decrease in development time because software construction is a systems effort with complex interdependencies
  - If task can be partioned without communication, men and months are interchangeable
  - For complex systems, communication and strategy onboarding takes up more time than is saved by dividing up tasks among more software engineers

- The author argues that 50% of the time estimate should be devoted to system integration testing
  - Misallocating the integration estimate can be costly because it has to be done at the end of the development life cycle right before the product is ready to ship

- The number of months depends on how sequential the components of the software product are
- The number of man-hours depends on how independent the sub tasks are
  - Adding men will not reduce the number of months because of the increased training, communication, and integration testing time between indepedently developed components
