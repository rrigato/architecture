- well thought out, meaningful work requires long stretches of uninterrupted focus
- Consider an individuals productivity before interrupting them to ask a question that does not need an ASAP response
- Keep your management/larger team involved by showing them a working demo as early as possible, assiging them tasks and soliciting their feedback
- Doing great work with a positive team is one of the most enduring forms of hapiness humans can tap into
- The key to a strong work environment is having as many team members as possible have a default optimistic personality


- Think about what can be applied from open source projects where 100's of contributors across different time zones sucessfully collaborate asyncronously without supervision
    - able to setup a local test environment in a standard way from the readme
    - eveything is out in the open (PR's, issues, bugs, and feature requests)


- working on exciting problems you are personally interested in results in higher long term quality and ownership to continually improve the software engineering process and the product itself
- Level the playing field for those working remote and in the office
- successful remote work depends on progress being capable of being made at any time and avoids manual roadblocks of *I have to wait 3 hours for coworker X to login and approve this manual process*
- Be vigilant of overwork, even if you enjoy your job, working more than 40 hours in a week just leads to burnout
