# software_guidelines_ch1
> architecture is a hypothesis that needs to be proven by the implementation

- software engineering requires a passion for the craft and a desire to be professional
- The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the desired system

# functionality_versus_maintainability_ch2
- The time it takes to make a change to a software system should be proportional to the size of the feature request, not where the feature request fits in the existing system

- It is easier to maintain a program that is easy to change, but does not meet the current business requirements than maintaining a program that meets the current business requirements but is impossible to change

# programming_paradigms_ch3_ch6

- structured programming taught us that unrestricted direct transfer of control like GOTO statements make it impossible to break down code into small, modular pieces

- We should never use break statements and strongly bias towards if/for loops transfering control to a function call?

- testing shows that a software product is correct enough for our purposes, not that a program is bug free
