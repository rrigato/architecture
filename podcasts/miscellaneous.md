- you can be an accidental information hoarder by not documenting properly

- there is always trade offs between dev and ops support

- think of dependencies not just in terms of a dependency breaking your application but also the security risks imposed


- documentation needs to be prioritized in your agile processes

- on call documentation that changes too frequently to keep up to date should just have a list of the person to contact in case of emergency
