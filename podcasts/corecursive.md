- accept that you will always have to work with legacy code

- Document the specific reasons why the legacy code is bad
  - Criticise only for learning purposes for improving the code 
  - Take ownership of the legacy code
  - Have empathy for the original developer 

- Do not do a refactoring project for legacy code if it does not drive business value

- Don't do documentation just to do it, but because it helps the business
  - Document things because you will need it when you look at this code in the future
