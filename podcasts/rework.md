Podcast from employees at basecamp

# [say no](https://rework.fm/say-no/)
- if you find employees are having to work extra hours just to get work done something is wrong

- don’t start with the work you want to get done, start with the team’s resource availability and prioritize work to fit that availability 

- change the question for requests from *can we make this happen* which is almost always yes with a skilled team, to *should we make this happen*



# [Jason Fried Industry 2017](https://rework.fm/jason-fried-industry-2017/)
- To make decisions you need to be close to the thing you are deciding
- be careful what you say yes to
  
- be conscious of the things that pour concrete (lock you into a decision)
  
- disagreeing and committing
  - vigorous discussion where one person makes the final call after everyone has provided their input


# [mailbag 2](https://rework.fm/mailbag-2/)
- management should actually write out/ document culture and work norms
- if you do not tell somebody why something happened, they will fill in why they think something happened with their own rendition


# [shape up](https://rework.fm/shape-up/)
- embrace boundaries as they shape your creativity and hammer down scope
- dont have a giant backlog grooming, just prioritize a few things that are timely
- bets should have a payoff (once you ship something you should be better off than the baseline)
- bets should have a fixed downside (time appetite)
- bets should be respected by having the dedicated time commitment
- always have your product in a working state, even if the ui looks terrible
- you cant give an R&D project and a deadline


# [jason freid dhh mailbag](https://rework.fm/rework-mailbag-3/)


- set and **document** expectations for response times

- have a relaxed state as the default 

- many deadlines are self imposed 

- disagree and commit

- most decisions are reversible and you need to realize you are maximizing decision efficiency over time

- be specific with the questions you are asking your managers if you want better feedback

- having good intentions is key to providing good feedback

- separate things you can control from the things you can’t control


# [No hard feelings](https://rework.fm/no-hard-feelings/)

- end a meeting 5 minutes early and reflect on what was learned 

- if work is the only thing you focus on, any aniexty from work is going to make it seem like your world is falling apart


# [rework faq part 1](https://rework.fm/remote-work-q-a-1/)
- automated status check ups for what your coworkers having been doing both inside and outside of work

- level the playing field- if you have partially remote, make everyone in the office dial in as well

- go from an email to a meeting when there is disagreement 

- value that not everyone needs to be in a meeting


# [remote faq part 2](https://rework.fm/remote-work-q-a-2/)

- make it clear that the receiver does not need to respond right away

- accountability is not killing yourself for imaginary deadlines

- the problem with meetings is you have to think of an answer immediately instead of having a full thought out response 


[dhh](https://www.rework.fm/greetings-from-mojito-island/)
- bugs are not a moral failing, they are the inevitable offshoot of non-trivial software applications 


- unless the bug impacts your ability to meet the minimum business requirements it should be treated as a feature request and prioritized accordingly 

- it is easy and cheap to commit to doing something in the future, but planning more than 1 cycle iteration in advance presumes that you know more about a future iteration's priorities now than you will as you get closer to that iteration
