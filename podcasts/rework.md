Podcast from employees at basecamp

# [say no](https://rework.fm/say-no/)
- if you find employees are having to work extra hours just to get work done something is wrong

- don’t start with the work you want to get done, start with the team’s resource availability and prioritize work to fit that availability 

- change the question for requests from *can we make this happen* which is almost always yes with a skilled team, to *should we make this happen*



# [Jason Fried Industry 2017](https://rework.fm/jason-fried-industry-2017/)
- To make decisions you need to be close to the thing you are deciding
- be careful what you say yes to
  
- be conscious of the things that pour concrete (lock you into a decision)
  
- disagreeing and committing
  - vigorous discussion where one person makes the final call after everyone has provided their input
