Podcast from employees at basecamp

# [say no](https://rework.fm/say-no/)
- if you find employees are having to work extra hours just to get work done something is wrong

- don’t start with the work you want to get done, start with the team’s resource availability and prioritize work to fit that availability 

- change the question for requests from ‘can we make this happen’ which is almost always yes with a skilled team, to ‘should we make this happen’
