Podcast from employees at basecamp

# [say no](https://rework.fm/say-no/)
- if you find employees are having to work extra hours just to get work done something is wrong

- don’t start with the work you want to get done, start with the team’s resource availability and prioritize work to fit that availability 

- change the question for requests from *can we make this happen* which is almost always yes with a skilled team, to *should we make this happen*



# [Jason Fried Industry 2017](https://rework.fm/jason-fried-industry-2017/)
- To make decisions you need to be close to the thing you are deciding
- be careful what you say yes to
  
- be conscious of the things that pour concrete (lock you into a decision)
  
- disagreeing and committing
  - vigorous discussion where one person makes the final call after everyone has provided their input


# [mailbag 2](https://rework.fm/mailbag-2/)
- management should actually write out/ document culture and work norms
- if you do not tell somebody why something happened, they will fill in why they think something happened with their own rendition


# [shape up](https://rework.fm/shape-up/)
- embrace boundaries as they shape your creativity and hammer down scope
- dont have a giant backlog grooming, just prioritize a few things that are timely
- bets should have a payoff (once you ship something you should be better off than the baseline)
- bets should have a fixed downside (time appetite)
- bets should be respected by having the dedicated time commitment
- always have your product in a working state, even if the ui looks terrible
- you cant give an R&D project and a deadline


# [jason freid dhh mailbag](https://rework.fm/rework-mailbag-3/)


- set and ** document** expectations for response times

- have a relaxed state as the default 

- many deadlines are self imposed 

- disagree and commit

- most decisions are reversible and you need to realize you are maximizing decision efficiency over time

- be specific with the questions you are asking your managers if you want better feedback

- having good intentions is key to providing good feedback

- separate things you can control from the things you can’t control
