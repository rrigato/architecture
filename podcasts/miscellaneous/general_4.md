- focus on what you can build/offer to a potential customer or employer instead of discussing what you will get out of it

- Mutual trust in software engineering = both developers go off to work on separate interfaces and they each know the other person will be implementing that interface in a way that directionally aligns with how they would implement


- donâ€™t try to focus on how the business need will change in 10 years, focus on what will stay the same as that is easier to predict


- prioritize features that customers need and you would also use

- making quick, reversible decisions is a skill
