- in a high release environment, there is always the possibility that new changes could potentially break your system, so having an alarm for every failure mode is impossible 


- their is a real engineer cost when it comes to false positives with monitoring and alerts


- process without purpose is meaningless 


- discretionary effort input = company makes a small upfront capital investment and the employee gets really interested and invests a bunch of personal time

- database immutability = no updates, only deletes and inserts


- good documentation has the user/client of the software in mind, not the creator
