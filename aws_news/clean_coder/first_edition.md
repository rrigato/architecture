# responsibility_ch1
- take responsibility to ensure no bugs make it to QA testers or your customers while also realizing that unexpected bugs occur and have the humility to apologize when they slip past your test suites

- merciless refactoring = always check code into your repo in better shape than you checked it out
- never modify software in a way that makes the software more difficult to change in the future
- professionals spend time outside of work caring for their profession
