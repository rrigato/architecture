# responsibility_ch1
- take responsibility to ensure no bugs make it to QA testers or your customers while also realizing that unexpected bugs occur and have the humility to apologize when they slip past your test suites

- merciless refactoring = always check code into your repo in better shape than you checked it out
- never modify software in a way that makes the software more difficult to change in the future
- professionals spend time outside of work caring for their profession

- doing your daily job is performance, you need to practice outside of your job to become a master performer
- professionals never demean fellow engineers for making a mistake and will always be willing to acknowledge when they make a mistake


# saying_no_ch2
- focus on providing ```just the facts``` of the timeline estimate not explaining the ```technical why``` unless prompted
- being a team player who says yes to trying to meet an impossible feature release timeline is worse than being professional and saying no from the beginning
- clean code is extendable, maintainable and lends itself to modification
- the stakeholders/users of an application will never care as much about the feature deadline as you do
- saying yes to dropping software quality in order to try to meet an unrealistic timeline ultimately slows down release velocity since you will no longer have an extendable code base


# saying_yes_ch3
- alert stakeholders as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be met
- If your feature release depends on an exterior team or technical unknowns, commit to actions that will unambiguously move you closer to releasing the feature that are in your control
- When working weekends, be honest about how (in)efficient your work will be, how much recovery time you will need to avoid burnout, and maintaining code quality standards to make sure you do not impact release velocity
