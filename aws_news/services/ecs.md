- cluster = collection of tasks or services
- task = docker container
- service = maintain a desired number of tasks
- task definition is via json file
- Using an ALB with ecs maps a dynamic port number so that multiple tasks can be listening on the same port and the same instance and be routed too
  - you still need a nat gateway if ecs is running in a private subnet
