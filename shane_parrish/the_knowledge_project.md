- Knowledge is about knowing when to listen and ponder an argument 
- every decision you make must be informed by first principles
- Paying attention is the heart of a moral life
  - not just in the activity that you're doing but also the meta/second order want of what you should be paying attention to

- Even if you read a book a week you'll only have the chance to read 2500 books before you die so choose wisely
