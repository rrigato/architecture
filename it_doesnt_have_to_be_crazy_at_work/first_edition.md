- habits that encourage calm are the only way to precipitate long term change
- disagree and commit = everyone on the team gets to give their feedback, but ultimately one person makes the final decision, explains their reasoning and everyone buys in
- do not work until a feature is perfect, work until releasing it would provide an upgrade over the as-is user experience
- no amount of efficiency gains can outpace simply eliminating an uneeded feature request
- do not pickup new feature requests within an iteration, all new development work ideas must be shaped before being prioritized into an iteration
- saying no to one feature request closes one door but leaves hunders of other possibilities open
- default of polite no does not need to be no forever, just that you are not going to drop everything to work on a new project suggestion immediately
- Having one customer driving feature requests can give them outsized influence on the product and instead of having a standard offering that appeals to many customers, you end up with a customized solution that appeals to one customer


- treat your development processes like you do your product: not as a fixed structure, but a malleable framework you are continually iterating on over time
