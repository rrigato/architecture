- habits that encourage calm are the only way to precipitate long term change
- disagree and commit = everyone on the team gets to give their feedback, but ultimately one person makes the final decision, explains their reasoning and everyone buys in
- do not work until a feature is perfect, work until releasing it would provide an upgrade over the as-is user experience
- no amount of efficiency gains can outpace simply eliminating an uneeded feature request
- do not pickup new feature requests within an iteration, all new development work ideas must be shaped before being prioritized into an iteration
- saying no to one feature request closes one door but leaves hunders of other possibilities open
- default of polite no does not need to be no forever, just that you are not going to drop everything to work on a new project suggestion immediately
- Having one customer driving feature requests can give them outsized influence on the product and instead of having a standard offering that appeals to many customers, you end up with a customized solution that appeals to one customer


- treat your development processes like you do your product: not as a fixed structure, but a malleable framework you are continually iterating on over time


# zen_of_calm
1) protect people's time
2) about 40 hours of work per week
3) reasonable expectations
4) meetings as a last resort
5) asyncronous first, real time second
6) independence over interdependence
7) long term sustainability



# workflow
- the best information you will have about a decision is at the moment of execution
- preference small feature decisions instead of one large year long plan set at the beginning of the year
- preference small feature decisions instead of one large year long plan set at the beginning of the year
- The reason 40 hours a week never seems like enough time is because work days are never uninterrupted continuous blocks of time to enable focus
- workdays have constant interruptions, whereas a 6 hour cross country flight feels like a never ending experience because it is continuous
- consolidate large chunks of time that can be used to accomplish one big task
- Constantly ask what features/scope can be cut out to make your software engineering process more effective



# interruptions

- modern offices are setup to be interruption factories: you can be tapped on the shoulder to start a conversation, pulled into a meeting, have to listen to loud open-office calls
- when someone takes time to ask a question/schedule a meeting it costs them nothing, but as the recipient you pay the prices
- The problem with meeting invites is the perception that declining them means you 'are not a team player'
- Have a culture where it is ok to question/decline meetings
- Meeting efficiency exponentially declines after 2 people
- There is value in being able to reach someone on demand in case of a fire drill, but ask yourself if setting policy based on events that occur 1% of the time is truly worth the productivity hit the other 99% of the time



- default instant messaging status = I'm trying to do my job, please respect my time and attention
- fear of missing out trancends social media and bleeds into work chat tools/news feeds leading to unrealistic response time expectations for stuff that ultimately does not matter
- prioritize poll based updates over push based
- managers need to be very explicit on what is a suggestion versus what is a mandate
  

- a calm work environment is achieved by living work life balance, not just talking about work life balance
- Breaking healthy long term sleeping habits is one of the most difficult trends to reverse
- lack of sleep contributes to decreased patience, understanding and tolerance
- if its easier for work to claim a Sunday than it is for life to borrow a Thursday, you are not achieving work life balance


- practice library rules in an office setting = a quiet place where each engineers attention, time and focus is respected
- if you see someone at their desk do not just walk over and interrupt them, assume they are deep in their work
- ambiguity breeds aniexty
- no fakecations = you should have a full technology sabbatical when on vacation in order to recharge


- important topics need time separation and reflection, not the immediate feedback/implied agreement a syncronous meetings/chat message provides
- send out the meeting outcome proposals before hand so that all attendees read and collect their thoughts instead of having a off the cuff/not well thought out feedback when they first hear about an idea in the meeting
- Don't have large software releases outside of normal working hours, on fridays or weekends, delay until they can be released calmly
