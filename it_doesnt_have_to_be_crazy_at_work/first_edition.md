- habits that encourage calm are the only way to precipitate long term change
- disagree and commit = everyone on the team gets to give their feedback, but ultimately one person makes the final decision, explains their reasoning and everyone buys in
- do not work until a feature is perfect, work until releasing it would provide an upgrade over the as-is user experience
- no amount of efficiency gains can outpace simply eliminating an uneeded feature request
- do not pickup new feature requests within an iteration, all new development work ideas must be shaped before being prioritized into an iteration
- saying no to one feature request closes one door but leaves hunders of other possibilities open
- default of polite no does not need to be no forever, just that you are not going to drop everything to work on a new project suggestion immediately
- Having one customer driving feature requests can give them outsized influence on the product and instead of having a standard offering that appeals to many customers, you end up with a customized solution that appeals to one customer


- treat your development processes like you do your product: not as a fixed structure, but a malleable framework you are continually iterating on over time


# zen_of_calm
1) protect people's time
2) about 40 hours of work per week
3) reasonable expectations
4) meetings as a last resort
5) asyncronous first, real time second
6) independence over interdependence
7) long term sustainability



# workflow
- the best information you will have about a decision is at the moment of execution
- preference small feature decisions instead of one large year long plan set at the beginning of the year
- preference small feature decisions instead of one large year long plan set at the beginning of the year
- The reason 40 hours a week never seems like enough time is because work days are never uninterrupted continuous blocks of time to enable focus
- workdays have constant interruptions, whereas a 6 hour cross country flight feels like a never ending experience because it is continuous
- consolidate large chunks of time that can be used to accomplish one big task
- Constantly ask what features/scope can be cut out to make your software engineering process more effective
