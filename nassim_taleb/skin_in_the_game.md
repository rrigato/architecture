- a performance cannot be judged unless it includes an analysis of its impacts on future results
- when people get rich they substitute contstructed preferences for their own

- A scholar should not be a libraries tool for making another library
- Barbell strategy of long lackadaisical walks falled by intense stressor activity and exercise
- Meta-probability = what is the probability that the probability distribution you were using is incorrect


- Individuals adopt the principles and norms of the environment they join
- The more you are abstracted away from the consequences of your actions, the more you likely you are to be indifferent to the consequences of those actions

- Focus on the authenticity of your words not the particular diction chosen
- Bureaucracy occurs when an individuals work is decoupled from the consequences of that work
- morally independent = finding a profession that fits your ethics instead of trying to fit ethics into your profession 
- Negative confirmation is more robust than positive confirmation


- When your private actions are opposed to your intellectual ideals you do not believe in those intellectual ideals
- Analyze what a person means not the statements that they say
- Summing up individual small probabilities converges to probability 1 in the limit 
- Going into an environment shapes your habbits into the habbits of all the people that are in that environment


- rational ignorance = you do not need to pay attention in domains where the cost of ignorance is zero

- Skin in the game is good for incentives and is a moral requirement if providing advice

- Fat tailed distributions are impossible to differentiate from thin tailed distributions until after a low probability, high impact event occurs

- The gaussian distribution is self-referential because you need the dataset in order to figure out what your probability distribution is and then also use that probability distribution to determine how much data you need to make inferences with the dataset

- A scholar should not be a libraries tool for making another library

- As humans we reduce the dimensionality of evidence into post-hoc justifications in order for them to be easily remembered
