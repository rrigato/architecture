- History is going to be dominated by an improbable event, do not try to predict what that event will be

- Do not question an experts procedure question there confidence 

- the more predictions humans make the more they holistically underestimate the variance regardless of bias

- The status quo isn't always just but it provides a baseline and framework for people to live their lives in

- Epistemic humility and skeptical empiricism 

- A library full of read books is much less valuable than a bookshelf of unread books

- Positive black swan events take much longer than negative black salon events 

- A turkey believes in its cordial relationship with the human race with increasing confidence for the first 1000 days until the 1001st day is the day before Thanksgiving

- Utopia = daily life is lived by the awareness of ignorance, not knowledge
