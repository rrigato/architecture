Collection of architecture notes I have from books, news feeds, online tech talks.

The goal is to slim down the source material into the smallest amount of actionable information

# aws_news_feed

## summary
aws has an rss style feed that describes
https://aws.amazon.com/new/

## recommendation
Yes, but do not read every post, skip the "AWS is expanding this service to region X in order to increase our number of service announcements on next year's reinvent presentation".

I personally skip stuff that is not applicable to me (Game tech, IoT, etc.)

The biggest benefit is I can find a new service or feature I was unaware of previously.

# architecture_patterns_with_python
authors:
- Harry Percival
- Bob Gregory

## summary 
Mostly focuses on domain driven design, event based architecture.

## recommendation
Skip, examples are way too specific to the retail use case. Some general material, but not enough to justify the time investment


# clean_architectures_in_python
authors:
- Leonardo Giordani

## summary 
Overview of the Clean Architecture with test driven examples with python

## recommendation
Yes, the second edition. The first edition tries to do too much with the test driven development.
One criticism I do have with this book is far too many external dependencies in my opinion.
