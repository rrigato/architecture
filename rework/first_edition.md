- planning for the future is guessing
- Workaholics aren't hereos, the real hero is already hoe because she figured out a faster way to get code shipped
- Throwing pure resource hours is not going to make an intellectual process more efficient
- what you build at work is your legacy, make sure you ship something that makes your customers lives better
- Most people do not want something bad enough to put in the time/effort to improve a broken process
- Create a solution for a problem you have, not an imaginary customer problem
- Software should be simple, reflect your values and feature slim
- Software engineering values are not just about writing them down, it is about living and believing in them even when no one is watching
- Experiment with different software development tools/techniques frequently, as that is the only way to discover more efficient processes
- enforce time constraints so you deliver a simple, easy solution to use
