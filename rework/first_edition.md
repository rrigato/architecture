- planning for the future is guessing
- Workaholics aren't hereos, the real hero is already home because she figured out a faster way to get code shipped
- Most people do not want something bad enough to put in the time/effort to improve a broken process
- Create a solution for a problem you have, not an imaginary customer problem
- Software should be simple, reflect your values and feature slim
- Software engineering values are not just about writing them down, it is about living and believing in them even when no one is watching
- Experiment with different software development tools/techniques frequently, as that is the only way to discover more efficient processes



- Constantly look to pair down features to their essentials
- A 1 hour meeting with 5 people is a 5 hour productivity loss plus the overhead of switching contexts
- Take small, incremental development steps so you can easily pivot with new information
- Enforcing time constraints incentivizes more efficient work processes
- Self-imposed constraints enable a freedom to focus on doing one thing well

- mission statements that do not stand in opposition to anything are meaningless because they are constructed to never risk offending a disenting opinion
