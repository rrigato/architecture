- prevents authorization code from being used if it is intercepted on response to client
- client generates a hashed secret it sends in the initial authorization request to obtain an authorization code
- when redeeming the authorization code for an access/refresh token, the token server uses the hashing algorithm to compare the initial request hashed secret to the subsequent token request unhashed secret
