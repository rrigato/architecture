- focus on what you can build/offer to a potential customer or employer instead of discussing what you will get out of it

- Mutual trust in software engineering = both developers go off to work on separate interfaces and they each know the other person will be implementing that interface in a way that directionally aligns with how they would implement


- donâ€™t try to focus on how the business need will change in 10 years, focus on what will stay the same as that is easier to predict


- prioritize features that customers need and you would also use

- making quick, reversible decisions is a skill



- being agile is delivering customer value ahead of schedule


- write your end user docs as you develop the feature


- only being enabled to fix the symptom but not the cause of a system issue is a big cause of burnout for engineers 


- ownership of your time is the most valuable resource you can provide your company
