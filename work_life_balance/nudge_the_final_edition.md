- planning fallacy = forecasts are inaccurate and wildly optimistic on when they will be completed, use PERT estimates
- status quo bias = human preference for the current baseline
- above average fallacy = overestimating your own skills compared to average
- libertarian paternalism = defaults are always going to exist in decision architecture, try to set defaults that the external agent would select if they had the time to choose the option that best fits their goal


- Curation is the key to success
- be careful of habits that have immediate satisfaction but poor long term outcomes
