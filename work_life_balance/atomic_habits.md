- **Document your personal aspirations and evaluate if you lived up to those ideals each day**

- tie good habits you don’t want to do with things you enjoy

- tie long term reward mechanisms to short term gratification 

> small changes make a big difference over time

- my criticism of this advice is it works great for savings accounts but it doesn’t work as well when there are a lot of confounding factors (nutrition advice)

- habit contract= negative feedback if you break your habit
