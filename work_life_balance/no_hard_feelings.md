# takeaways
- Embrace being strictly unproductive in off work hours
- Evaluate long term decisions with the question:
> how will I regret this decision in 5 years




- Talk openly about emotions in a non-accusatory way:
> I feel anxious when action X occurs

*instead of*
> You taking action X makes me feel anxious
