- mathematics is principally a tool for meditation, not computation
- asymmetric bets = betting on an outcome that is probablistically unlikely but has a correspondingly large expected return

- Having a 90% chance of an unfavorable outcome is still positive expected value if the return is 50x
- position yourself to benefit from a low probability, high magnitude risk ocurring instead of attempting to predict which of the many possible low probability events will occur
