Outage goals:
- Declare an outage when customers are actually impacted
- Know when customers are impacted before they contact us


> The mental model we all create of the systems we build need to include the people operating these systems and what information we present to them during operating these systems


> The organization needs to recognize human single points of failure as both a burnout risk for that person and a business liability for the team when that person is absent/unreachable


- incident reviews should not be limited to customer facing incidents

- Have an incident response runbook written by the team that designed the application with common debugging steps

- encourage curiousity around seemingly transient issues that did not result in a customer outage but could be a canary for future issues
