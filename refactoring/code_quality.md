- the inherent value in investing in high internal code quality is the ability to release new features more quickly


- the initial feature release time might be quicker in a low quality code base


- there is no trade off between having a system that is stable in prod and having a system where you release features more regularly  as more frequent prod releases improves prod system stability 


- focus on selling the economic benefits of high internal code quality instead of the moralistic professionalism arguments 


- even software engineers who follow TDD, have CI/CD pipelines, write modular code, follow SOLID still do accumulate technical debt because end user requirements change once they get their hands on a released product



- the best engineers focus on continually refactoring and continuously improving their development process in order to avoid having unexpected requirements impact new feature release velocity
