- the initial feature release time might be quicker in a low quality code base


- more frequent prod releases correlate with increased prod system stability 


- focus on selling the economic benefits of high internal code quality instead of professionalism arguments 


- even software engineers who follow TDD, have CI/CD pipelines, write modular code, follow SOLID accumulate technical debt because end user requirements change once they begin using a released product



- the best engineers focus on continually refactoring and continuously improving their development process in order to avoid having unexpected new requirements impact new feature release velocity
